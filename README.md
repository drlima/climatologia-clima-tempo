#  Scrappying data from climatempo.com.br/climatologia/* using scrapy

## Installing scrapy
This code was written in Python 3.6 and uses [scrapy 1.4.0](https://scrapy.org/).

You should install scrapy with pip:
```pip install --user scrapy```

**Note**: on my system, python points to python3.6 and pip points to pip3, you should check your defaults before running it.
